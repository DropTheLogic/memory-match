# Memory Match Duel
-------------------
![screenshot](/docs/Memory_Match_Screens.jpg)
Memory Match Duel is an online, two-player board game. Users can connect from their phone or browser. They will be auto-generated a user name and avatar and given the option to create a game room or join a game room (if one exists).

## Gameplay
The gameboard consists of tiles, randomly generated, which are dealt blank side up, face side down. Users will take turns flipping over pieces of the board, two tiles per turn. If a user matches two tiles with their turn, they have "captured" those tiles, and are scores for a match. When all the tiles have been matched, the user with the most matches wins. The options to rematch should be presented at the end of each match.

## Tools
This app was built using React and Firebase, with images from the [Adorable Avatars](http://avatars.adorable.io/) API.

-------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
